        Discuss the scope of <span class="bg-slate-400 px-2 rounded-lg text-white">var</span>, <span
          class="bg-slate-400 px-2 rounded-lg text-white">let</span>, and <span

        <p class="text-base font-semibold">The "Var" or variable is a common and a very essential component of
          JavaScript. It's like a magical element
          which works differently other than "let" and "const" variables.
          <br>
          The "var" variable is kind of function level itself. It behaves as it is a global variable and the interesting
          fact is it can be accessed throughout the entire function in which it is declared.

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>


          let's look at an example. <br>



          <span class="text-lg text-red-400 font-extrabold">
            function example() { <br>
            if (true) { <br>
            var x = 10; <br>
            } <br>
            console.log(x); <br>
            }
          </span>


          <br>


          here, the "var" can be accessed throughout the entire function.

          <br>
          <br>
          <br>


          On the other hand, "let" an "const" are both block level variables which can't be accessed as "var" but
          there's a little difference between them.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          The "let" allows to change the values of the variables even it is declared before but the "const" is
          unchangeable.

    <div class="collapse mt-5 collapse-plus bg-base-200">

      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
        Tell us the use cases of <span class="bg-slate-400 px-2 rounded-lg text-white">null</span> and <span
          class="bg-slate-400 px-2 rounded-lg text-white">undefined</span>
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p class="text-base font-semibold">"null" is generally an empty value which is used to show intentionally as
          empty. It is a variable which act
          or is used as it shouldn't have a value.

          <br>
          <br>
          for example:
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="text-lg text-red-400 font-extrabold">
            let selectedOption = null;
          </span>
          <br>
          <br>

          Here, the "let" variable is used to intentionally show an empty value.


          <br>
          <br>
          <br>

          On the other hand, "undefined" acts differently. It pops up when an user trying to get an output but the value
          isn't assigned yet. If the user trying to get an output without declaring a certain value the "undefined" will
          appear.
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          for example:
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="text-lg text-red-400 font-extrabold">
            let age;
            console.log(age);
          </span>

      <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">
        What do you mean by REST API?
      </div>
      <div class="collapse-content">
        <p class="text-base font-semibold">
          The REST API in JavaScript works as a bridge for different softwares or applications to contact with one
          another over a network system or it can be called "The Internet".

          <br>
          <br>

          It works as a communicator. Suppose JOHN ordered a PS5 on the internet. The provider will not directly deliver
          the PS5 to JOHN. The provider will get the order from Internet and then he will command the delivery-man to
          deliver the PS5 to JOHN.

          <br>
          <br>

          In the same way, when an user requests a data to a server, the API of that server receive the request first
          and then send it to the main or Host server. Then the Host server checks if the request is valid or not. If
          the request is valid then it gives the requested data to the API and the API then delivers the data to the
          user.
